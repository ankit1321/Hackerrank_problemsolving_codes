# Hackerrank_problemsolving_codes

#Mark_and_toys problem solution is given in c language.


Firstly I tried this problem with bubble sort but for some test case "Time Out" occured.
Hence I changed my sorting algorithm to Quick sort.
But Bubble sort is also kept in comments. 

#Bubble Sort

Pseudo code for sorting is written and standard Input and Output is already given.[Whole code is shared with stdin and stdout].

#Kangaroo

Pseudo code for kangaroo jumping is written and standard Input and Output is already given.[Whole code is shared with stdin and stdout].

#Printing_patterns_with loops

Using looping concept pattern is printed and whole code is written in main function.Six loops are used for printing pattern.Loops can be reduced , if someone can reduce the loop and fork it.It will be grateful.
