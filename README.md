# Hackerrank_problemsolving_codes

#Mark_and_toys problem solution is given in c language.


Firstly I tried this problem with bubble sort but for some test case "Time Out" occured.
Hence I changed my sorting algorithm to Quick sort.
But Bubble sort is also kept in comments. 

#Bubble Sort

Pseudo code for sorting is written and standard Input and Output is already given.[Whole code is shared with stdin and stdout].

#Kangaroo

Pseudo code for kangaroo jumping is written and standard Input and Output is already given.[Whole code is shared with stdin and stdout].

#Picking Numbers

Function for picking numbers is bieng written by me to find maximum number of integers you can select from the array
such that the absolute difference between any two of the chosen integers is <=1.
